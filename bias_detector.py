bias_detector.py
----------------
Detects three cognitive biases from a completed consultation session.
Called by app.py after user submits diagnosis via POST /conclude.

Three bias types detected:
  1. Anchoring — fixating on the most obvious symptom
  2. Premature closure — concluding before thorough workup
  3. Confirmation bias — only seeking confirming evidence

All detection logic is derived from docs/pseudocode.md Section MODULE 2.
Each detector returns a dict:
  {detected: bool, score: float 0-1, reason: str, evidence: list}
