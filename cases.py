# All 5 cases share this identical list of ~80 tests so students cannot
# infer the diagnosis from which tests are available.
#
# Each entry has:
#   label         : display name shown on the chip button
#   group         : section heading in the UI (groups chips visually)
#   normal_result : what the student sees when this test is ordered in a

#                   "nothing found here" report.

# Per-case RESULT OVERRIDES live in each case's "investigations" dict.
# app.py: if test_key is in case["investigations"], return that result;

# MASTER EXAMINATIONS — Universal panel shown to students on EVERY case
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Mirrors the MASTER_INVESTIGATIONS approach for physical examination.
# All 5 cases share this identical list of ~28 examination systems so
# students cannot narrow the diagnosis from which systems are available.
#
# Each entry has:
#   label         : chip label shown in the UI
#   group         : section heading (groups chips visually)
#   normal_result : the finding returned when this system is NOT
#                   relevant to the current case — always a normal report.
#
# Per-case FINDING OVERRIDES live in each case's "examination" dict.
# app.py: if exam_key is in case["examination"], return that finding;
#         otherwise return MASTER_EXAMINATIONS[exam_key]["normal_result"].
# clinical_evaluator.py: still grades on case["examination"] only.
